*Crouch is more effective between crevices


NEW ADDITIONS:

*Weapon Inventory System

ABOUT ADDITIONS:

*To Switch Weapons, use the Mouse Wheel Up or Down
*To Crouch, Press C(Forgot to mention in previous build)
*Inventory system has two arrays: Default Weapons and Weapon Inventory.
Default Inventory is what the designer CAN put for the character.
Weapon Inventory is something to not tamper with for it's where it holds the INSTANCES of the weapon
*Weapon Fire is not fully done yet. Waiting on docs to whether to have SkeletalMesh or StaticMesh
*Weapon & Ammo Pickup works fine, however, there is no ammo meshes yet.
*Weapon Base Class has many visual variables that the developer can set without the programming hassle
(Refer to Image Docs)
*HUD Weapon Display is still being worked on. It does display the splash arts of the weapons(but they are random images)

1.) Unpack the Transend.rar file

*Weapon Pickup Works for both Primary and Secondary.


ABOUT ADDITIONS:

*To change projectile types, In the Weapon blueprint, select the projectile drop
menu. it should have these three selections: Bullet, Projectile, Melee(WIP). for 
Bullet, be sure to adjust the Config variable accordingly. Projectile MUST have
a Projectile blueprint in the WeaponProj drop menu. If not, the engine will crash

*The WeaponProj drop menu gives the developer options for different types of projectiles depending on their behavior(like rocket, seeking rocket, grenades, etc). This must be filled in order for a projectile to fire.

*To change or add a weapon sound(sound for firing weapon only yet), The developer must add a sound in the Weapon Blueprint under Config->Fire Sound and there should be a drop menu for any sound cue the developer wishes. This works for all projectile types.

*If importing custom weapons to the engine and wanting to fire them, The developer must add a socket on the mesh(for now, import as static mesh) called "MF". If no socket is on the mesh, there will be no where for the weapon to shoot out any sort of projectile fire.

*In order to make a weapon to be a pickup, Put a Weapon Blueprint in the scene. If the player wishes to make the weapon have a specific amoun of ammo on pickup, click the weapon blueprint on the SCENE and go to the Config portion of the weapon in the Details window under the Scene Outliner.

*OnHit Enemy and Actor Identification for all Projectile classes
