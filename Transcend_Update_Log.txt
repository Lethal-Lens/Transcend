*Crouch is more effective between crevices


NEW ADDITIONS:

*Weapon Inventory System
*Weapon Base Class(WIP)

ABOUT ADDITIONS:

Default Inventory is what the designer CAN put for the character.
Weapon Inventory is something to not tamper with for it's where it holds the INSTANCES of the weapon
*Weapon Fire is not fully done yet. Waiting on docs to whether to have SkeletalMesh or StaticMesh
*Weapon & Ammo Pickup works fine, however, there is no ammo meshes yet.
*Weapon Base Class has many visual variables that the developer can set without the programming hassle
(Refer to Image Docs)
*HUD Weapon Display is still being worked on. It does display the splash arts of the weapons(but they are random images)

1.) Unpack the Transend.rar file
2.) Delete Transend.sln

TRANSEND - BUILD 01/06/2014 - UPDATE FROM CHAD

*Weapon Projectile Base Class
*Weapon Projectile Selection

*Shotgun_BP & Pistol_BP Blueprint Template in Blueprints/Weapon folder in Engine
*projTest Template for projectile in Blueprint/Weapon Folder in Engine
*Weapon Pickup Works for both Primary and Secondary.


ABOUT ADDITIONS:

*To change projectile types, In the Weapon blueprint, select the projectile drop
menu. it should have these three selections: Bullet, Projectile, Melee(WIP). for 
Bullet, be sure to adjust the Config variable accordingly. Projectile MUST have
a Projectile blueprint in the WeaponProj drop menu. If not, the engine will crash

*The WeaponProj drop menu gives the developer options for different types of projectiles depending on their behavior(like rocket, seeking rocket, grenades, etc). This must be filled in order for a projectile to fire.

*To change or add a weapon sound(sound for firing weapon only yet), The developer must add a sound in the Weapon Blueprint under Config->Fire Sound and there should be a drop menu for any sound cue the developer wishes. This works for all projectile types.

*If importing custom weapons to the engine and wanting to fire them, The developer must add a socket on the mesh(for now, import as static mesh) called "MF". If no socket is on the mesh, there will be no where for the weapon to shoot out any sort of projectile fire.

*In order to make a weapon to be a pickup, Put a Weapon Blueprint in the scene. If the player wishes to make the weapon have a specific amoun of ammo on pickup, click the weapon blueprint on the SCENE and go to the Config portion of the weapon in the Details window under the Scene Outliner.

TRANSEND - BUILD 02/03/2015 - UPDATE FROM CHAD

CHANGES:
*Fixed XP Levels to enable double jump and sprinting on Level 2 XP(For testing)

NEW ADDITIONS:
*Added the Animation Starter Pack to the project for testing. The mannequin interacts with the Walking, Crouching, and Jumping(Jumping is slightly bugged)

*Added all 50 Level change Enums.
*Weapon Line Trace Identification is no longer a WIP
*Projectile Identification is no longer a WIP
*Added Reload Sounds(WIP until Animations are done)
*Added Checkpoint Implementation(Alpha)
*Added Respawn Once Dead
*Added Camera dislocation upon falling into death hole
*Added UMG Death Screen
*Player Health Code is in progress
*Weapon Clip and Ammo Depletion is no longer a WIP

ABOUT ADDITIONS:
*Animation starter Pack is something just for the weapon aiming and the AI work until the Character Mesh and Animations come in(Paul, go ahead and begin work with the AI :) )
*50 Level Enums are present, but only TWO levels do anything and are measured at the moment. Once the AI and Level design is ready, we can start talking numbers on balance for the XP Levels
*Reload Sounds are there, but need animation states for the Start Sound and finished sound for the reloading. If you wish to check out the reload sound now, BE SURE to ONLY use the Reload Start Sound.
*Checkpoint Implementation is in Alpha. In order to make the Checkpoints work, the developer must add a Rabbit_BP onto the scene, and use level blueprint to ensure the start of the game to add the level checkpoints to the Rabbit blueprint. The checkpoint storage should be called "Spawn Location".
*Respawn Once Dead only works if the developer adds a "Transcend Kill Volume" to the scene. If the developer wants to dislocate the camera from the character, they must add a trigger volume and use Level BP to dislocate it(See level_1 Level blueprint for reference)
*UMG Death Screen is just a simple "You are dead, Loading to current checkpoint". If the UI Designer wishes to update this, you may. the Widget blueprint is called "Death_Screen". located in Blueprints->UI
